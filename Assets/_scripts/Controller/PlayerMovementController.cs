    /*Inertia: Ships don't stop or turn instantlyâ€”they have momentum.
    Gradual turning: Ships turn slowly rather than changing direction instantly.
    Acceleration and deceleration: Ships need time to speed up and slow down.
    Rotation based on input: Instead of just translating in the direction of input, the ship needs to rotate and move in its forward direction.
    Steps to Simulate Ship Movement:
    Use the direction vector for rotation control (i.e., the ship "points" towards a desired direction).
    Move the ship gradually forward based on its current facing direction (forward vector).
    Implement smooth turning, acceleration, and deceleration.*/
